  <h2>What we do to protect and take care of your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We only rely on Facebook for the login part</li>
    <p>
      This means that we never see your login data, and have no control over it.
    </br>
      This is to give you full peace-of-mind whilst using our platform!
    </p>

  </br>

  <li>We don't store your data, so we have no means of accessing your account.</li><p>
    This is because we don't want to have access to your account. </br>Beware though,  we do assign your account a unique user ID, which can be </br>linked back to your account in case of problems with content uploaded to our </br>platform.
